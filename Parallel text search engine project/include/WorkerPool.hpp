WorkerPool â€“ Worker Pool (Threads):
Create N threads (start()),
each of which will pull a task (file path) from a shared queue, scan the file (using FileScanner), save results locally,
and finally merge the results into a central structure,
then allow the main thread to wait for them all to finish (join()),
and retrieve all results via results().
